## Introducing Mi_Records

**Good day, welcome to my blog. Today we will be presenting MI_Records, an open-source self-management system for developers. **

#  Inspiration
I know there are a lot of self-management systems on the market already, but looking at all of them, none fit a developer's needs.

From my experiences as a developer, keeping track of projects, events, finances, etc are very important. I face challenges meeting up with events and multiple tasks.

- Keeping records of projects, using date and time to set projects deadline. This is helpful for younger developers like me who come up with multiple ideas and are unable to complete them because they want to jump to their next idea. So setting a reminder and also writing a to-do for each project will help me manage more than one project at a time.

- Keeping track of your completed projects and personal information makes it easy for the website to automatically generate a portfolio for a developer. A unique URL will be generated for your portfolio. It can be downloaded as (a PDF) and printed directly from the user's unique URL.

- It takes me time to get my social links when the needs arise, 
I usually have to log in (e.g., *Facebook*, *Twitter*, *e.t.c*) to get my profile link when a site registration requires it or when it is needed urgently, which is time-consuming.

- keep track of your finances. You can keep a record of savings and calculate your tithe (10%) from income.

- set events and task reminders using deadlines to keep track of them.
